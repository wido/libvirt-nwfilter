# Libvirt Network Filter
This repository contains some XML files for testing the [Libvirt network filters](https://libvirt.org/formatnwfilter.html) in order to implement them in [Apache CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/)

I used a single VM running locally with libvirt and virt-manager to check if I could replicate all the things CloudStack can do.
